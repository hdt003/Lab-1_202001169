**Identifying Functional and Non-Functional Requirements**


**Q.1. Identify FRs and NFRs:**  

**Functional requirements**  

* Users Login: User needs to register for the LIS. 
Three kind of users : members, Librearian , non-members

* In LIS it allows members to borrow book or return with ease while sitting at his desk

* THe member can extend the date of his borrowing if no other booking for that particular book has been made.

* The librarian, who has administrative privileges and complete control over the system, can enter a new record into the system when a new book has been purchased, or remove a record in case any book is taken off the shelf.

* Any non-member is free to use this system to browse/search books online. However, issuing or returning books is restricted to valid users (members) of LIS only.

**Non-functional requirements**

* LIS system is web application

* It is made with HTML5 .

* The softwarte LIS must run on institute LAN only

* Security:
Only Librarian can have administrative privileges and complete control over the system can enter new record.

* Scalability:
to determine the highest workloads under which the system will still perform as expected 
The system data mustbe stay in system not to leak any where

**Q.2. Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.**

**Project Scope**

* Planning:  
Designing a system that detects high volume sounds and immediately alerts the user based on it.
* Controlling:  
First we propose a basic design of the system. After that we implement the design to an actual working system. Based on our output, we may or may not consider the modifications.
* Closing:   
We do a detailed assessment of our final system with the one that we had planned to design.
Functional requirements:

->Recognizing high volume sounds.

->Alerting the user based on the sounds.

->Very less or no delay in case of alerting the user.

->AI enabled with strong sense of recognizing the sounds of car horns, babies etc.

**Non-functional requirements**

* Reliability:

The system should be trustworthy in providing alerts at the right time to users.

* Security:

The personal data of users should remain secure within the system.

* Performance:

The system should be high performing in the sense that it gives accurate alerts to the user.
The system should alert the user only when needed and not on every sound that is heard.

* Scalability:

As stated that approx 5% of the world population is suffering from hearing loss, we need to attempt to scale the system to each individual for their safety and security.
